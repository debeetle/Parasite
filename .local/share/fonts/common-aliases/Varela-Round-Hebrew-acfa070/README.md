# Varela Round (Latin + Hebrew)
By Joe Prince & Avraham Cornfeld

Varela Round is based on the well known font Varela. 
Its rounded corners make it perfect for a soft feel and work great at any size. 
It is suitable for headlines and printed collateral, and maintains its distinct properties amongst other objects. 
Varela Round is a great font for any website.

The Latin component was designed by Joe Prince (Admix Designs). 
The Hebrew component was designed by Avraham Cornfeld ([AlefAlefAlef](http://alefalefalef.co.il)). 

The Varela Round project is led by Avraham Cornfeld, a type designer based in Israel.
